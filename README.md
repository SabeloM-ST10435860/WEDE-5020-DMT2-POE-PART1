## DESIGN AND USER EXPERIENCE  
The website is responsive, and the layout will ensure that visitors can easily navigate through web 
pages (Nielsen, 2012).  
It will use a modern clean sans-serif font such as Roboto or Open Sans for headings, body texts and 
paragraphs to improve readability and give a professional look. The website will use a colour palette 
that is cloud-inspired with blue, white and a shade of black to represent trust, reliability and 
technology (Lupton, 2014).  
 
## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS  
The website will be developed using modern technologies to ensure high performance and security. 
For the front-end we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive user 
webpages (MDN Web Docs, 2023).  
The back-end will use PHP, which is mostly used for handling server-side logic and database 
communication (Flanagan, 2020).  
A MySQL database system will be implemented to support structured data management depending 
on the needs of the business (Chodorow, 2013).  
For hosting, the website will use AWS- Amazon Web Services as they provide reliable uptime, 
security, and international scalability (Amazon Web Services, 2022). 

## TIMELINE AND MILESTONES  
Week 1–2: Planning and Designing phase  
The phase focuses on gathering all the requirements and identifying the target audience. A demo 
website is created to give a clue of the layout and user interface. The design must align with the 
organization’s (Pressman, 2015).

Week 3–5: Development and Content Integration phase  
In this phase developers build the front end and back end of the website using the abovementioned 
technologies. Content such as company information, services and images are added (Flanagan, 
2020).  
Week 6: Testing and Optimization phase  
The functionality, performance and security of the website is tested. Problems such as broken links, 
slow loading, and security vulnerabilities are noted and fixed. Optimization is performed to ensure 
fast loading speed and an uninterrupted user experience in different devices (Sommerville, 2016).

Week 7: Launching and Training phase  
The complete website is deployed to a live server and accessible to customers and the public. 
Administrators and other team members are trained to manage and update the web page content 
when needed (Laudon & Laudon, 2020).
